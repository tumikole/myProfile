            Hey there... My name is Ramollo Samuel Tumisang. I am 31 years old.
            Still living with my mom but spent most of my years with my
            grandparents. I always act more mature than my age. I have had a lot
            of people invest in me academically, so I have tried my utmost in
            most of my classes. My hobbies include music, reading, and
            traveling. Although I don’t get to travel much. I am generally
            pleased with my life. I grew up in a place/village called Madidi in
            North West. Spent most of my life there. I moved there in late 2009
            and started to live with my mom at Pretoria Centurion
            (Olievenhoutbosch). I have been passionate about personal computers
            and media designs. I completed my matric in 2009 and went to DSDC
            college the following year for a matric upgrade hoping to enroll at
            one of the best universities in South Africa. I was hoping to do
            Multimedia design. In 2012 I enrolled at Sokhele college for a call
            center certificate and Worked for Affinity mobile sponsored by 8ta,
            based in Sunnyside Pretoria. I also completed a security grade E - C
            certificate in 2013. In 2015 joined Imvula Quality Protection and
            served my three-year contract with no faulty issues. In 2016 I was
            awarded the commendation of service excellence at Imvula Quality
            Protection for saving one of my colleague’s life.</p>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "left", color: "white" }}> I joined THE
            CODING GROUND in 2021 as a full-stack software developer and also
            because I love coding I want to become the one of best software
            developers in the world. I am just glad that I got a chance to
            fulfill my dream of becoming a software developer.
